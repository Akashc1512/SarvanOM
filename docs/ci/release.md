- **Real-time**: Changes take effect immediately
- **Audit Trail**: All flag changes logged
- **Access Control**: Role-based flag management

### 2. Feature Flag Implementation

#### 2.1 Backend Implementation
```python
from shared.core.feature_flags import FeatureFlags

@FeatureFlags.require("new_query_engine")
async def process_query(query: str):
    # New implementation
    pass

@FeatureFlags.fallback("new_query_engine")
async def process_query_legacy(query: str):
    # Legacy implementation
    pass
```

#### 2.2 Frontend Implementation
```typescript
import { useFeatureFlag } from '@/hooks/useFeatureFlag';

function QueryInterface() {
  const newUI = useFeatureFlag('new_query_ui');
  
  return newUI ? <NewQueryUI /> : <LegacyQueryUI />;
}
```

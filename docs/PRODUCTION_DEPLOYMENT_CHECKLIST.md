## **🚀 DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Final System Verification**
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate

# Verify all services
python -c "
import asyncio
from shared.core.services.startup_warmup_service import get_startup_warmup_service

async def verify():
    service = get_startup_warmup_service()
    result = await service.warmup_all_services()
    print(f'🎯 System ready: {result}')

asyncio.run(verify())
"

# Test critical endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics/performance
curl "http://localhost:8000/search?q=test&limit=3"
```

### **Step 2: Start Production Server**
```bash
# Production startup with optimized settings
uvicorn services.gateway.main:app \
  --host 0.0.0.0 \
  --port 8000 \
  --workers 4 \
  --access-log \
  --log-level info \
  --reload false
```

### **Step 3: Load Testing Validation**
```bash
# Run production load tests
python scripts/load_test_production.py

# Expected results:
# - Success rate: >95%
# - P95 response time: <3000ms
# - Performance grade: A or B
```

### **Step 4: Monitoring Deployment**
```bash
# Monitor performance metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics/performance

# Monitor system health
curl http://localhost:8000/health/warmup

# Monitor cost efficiency
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics/performance | jq '.monitoring.cost_efficiency'
```

curl http://localhost:8000/metrics/lanes | jq .performance_summary

# Solutions:
# - Restart services to clear any memory leaks
# - Check ArangoDB server performance
# - Verify cache hit rates
# - Review API provider response times
```

#### **🚨 API Cost Spikes**
```bash
# Check cost metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics/performance | jq .performance_summary.cost_summary

# Solutions:
# - Review provider routing (prioritize free APIs)
# - Increase cache TTL
# - Reduce query complexity
# - Enable more aggressive circuit breakers
```

#### **🚨 Service Failures**
```bash
# Check overall health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Check individual services
curl http://localhost:8000/health/warmup

# Solutions:
# - Restart failed services
# - Check environment variables
# - Verify API key validity
# - Review service logs
```

# Model Selector Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of a model selector feature that allows users to choose between different LLM providers (Ollama, OpenAI, HuggingFace) when submitting queries to the Universal Knowledge Platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Frontend Model Selector UI
- **Location**: `frontend/src/ui/QueryForm.tsx`
- **Components Added**:
  - Model selection dropdown using Shadcn/UI Select component
  - Three available models: Ollama (Local), OpenAI GPT-4, HuggingFace API
  - Each model option includes an icon and description
  - Real-time display of selected model information
  - Updated submit button text to reflect selected model

### 2. API Service Updates
- **Location**: `frontend/src/services/api.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `model` parameter to `QueryRequest` interface
  - Updated `submitComprehensiveQuery` method to accept model selection
  - Modified `submitQuery` method to include model in request body
  - Enhanced JSDoc documentation with model selection examples

### 3. Backend Integration
- **Location**: `services/api_gateway/`
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `IntegrationRequest` class to include `model` parameter
  - Modified comprehensive query endpoint to handle model selection
  - Enhanced orchestrator to pass model preference through the pipeline
  - Updated response format to include `llm_provider` and `llm_model` fields

### 4. Orchestrator Updates
- **Location**: `shared/core/agents/lead_orchestrator.py`
- **Changes**:
  - Enhanced `select_llm_provider` method to accept user model preference
  - Updated `process_query` method to extract model from user context
  - Modified synthesis phase to pass selected model to agents
  - Added comprehensive logging for model selection traces

### 5. Answer Display Enhancement
- **Location**: `frontend/src/ui/AnswerDisplay.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Added model information display in answer card
  - Shows which LLM provider was used for the response
  - Displays model name alongside generation timestamp

## Technical Implementation Details

### Model Selection Flow
1. **User Selection**: User selects a model from the dropdown in QueryForm
2. **API Call**: Model selection is passed to `submitComprehensiveQuery`
3. **Backend Processing**: Model preference is included in the request body
4. **Orchestrator**: Model selection is extracted and used for LLM provider selection
5. **Response**: Model information is included in the response and displayed to user

### Fallback Mechanism
- If user selects an invalid model, the system falls back to automatic selection
- If the selected model is unavailable, the system tries alternative providers
- Comprehensive error handling and logging for model selection failures

### Available Models
1. **Ollama (Local)**: Fast local AI model running on user's device
2. **OpenAI GPT-4**: Advanced cloud AI model with high capacity
3. **HuggingFace API**: Research-focused AI model for specialized tasks

## Code Changes Summary

### Frontend Changes
```typescript
// QueryForm.tsx - Added model selector
const AVAILABLE_MODELS = [
  { value: "ollama", label: "Ollama (Local)", description: "Fast local AI model", icon: Cpu },
  { value: "openai", label: "OpenAI GPT-4", description: "Advanced cloud AI model", icon: Sparkles },
  { value: "huggingface", label: "HuggingFace API", description: "Research-focused AI model", icon: Search },
];

// API service - Added model parameter
export interface QueryRequest {
  model?: string; // Add model selection
  // ... other fields
}
```

### Backend Changes
```python
# IntegrationRequest - Added model field
@dataclass
class IntegrationRequest:
    model: str = "auto"  # Add model selection with auto fallback

# LeadOrchestrator - Enhanced model selection
async def select_llm_provider(self, query: str, context_size: int = 0, selected_model: str = "auto") -> LLMProvider:
    if selected_model != "auto":
        try:
            return LLMProvider(selected_model)
        except ValueError:
            logger.warning(f"Invalid model selection '{selected_model}', falling back to auto selection")
```

## Testing

### Test Script
- **Location**: `test_model_selector.py`
- **Features**:
  - Tests API health and connectivity
  - Tests each model with sample queries
  - Tests fallback mechanism for invalid models
  - Verifies frontend integration points

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the backend server
2. Start the frontend application
3. Navigate to the query form
4. Select different models from the dropdown
5. Submit queries and verify the model information is displayed
6. Check backend logs for model selection traces

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Choice**: Users can select the AI model that best fits their needs
- **Transparency**: Users can see which model was used for their response
- **Performance**: Different models offer different speed/quality trade-offs
- **Cost Control**: Users can choose free local models vs. paid cloud models

### Technical Benefits
- **Modularity**: Easy to add new models in the future
- **Fallback**: Robust error handling and automatic fallback
- **Logging**: Comprehensive tracing for debugging and monitoring
- **Extensibility**: Framework supports adding more model options

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Model Comparison**: Show performance metrics for each model
2. **Cost Estimation**: Display estimated costs for paid models
3. **Model Health**: Show availability status for each provider
4. **Custom Models**: Allow users to add their own model endpoints
5. **Model Preferences**: Remember user's preferred model per query type

### Additional Models
- **Anthropic Claude**: For high-quality reasoning tasks
- **Google Gemini**: For multimodal capabilities
- **Azure OpenAI**: For enterprise deployments
- **Custom Endpoints**: For organization-specific models

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
The system uses existing environment variables for API keys:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: For OpenAI models
- `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY`: For HuggingFace models
- `OLLAMA_BASE_URL`: For Ollama local models

### Model Configuration
Models can be configured in the frontend constants:
```typescript
const AVAILABLE_MODELS = [
  // Add new models here
];
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Backend Logs
- Model selection is logged with trace IDs
- Fallback decisions are logged with warnings
- Performance metrics are tracked per model

### Frontend Analytics
- Model selection events can be tracked
- User preferences can be analyzed
- Performance comparisons can be generated

## Conclusion

The model selector implementation provides users with control over which AI model processes their queries while maintaining robust fallback mechanisms and comprehensive error handling. The implementation is modular and extensible, allowing for easy addition of new models and features in the future.

The feature enhances the user experience by providing transparency about which model was used and allowing users to optimize for their specific needs (speed, quality, cost, etc.).

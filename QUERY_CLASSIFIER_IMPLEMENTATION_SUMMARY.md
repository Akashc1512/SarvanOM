## Test Results

### Classification Accuracy

**Knowledge Graph Queries:**
- "What is the relationship between machine learning and artificial intelligence?" → `knowledge_graph` (confidence: 0.20)
- "How are neural networks connected to deep learning?" → `knowledge_graph` (confidence: 0.25)
- "What entities are related to blockchain technology?" → `knowledge_graph` (confidence: 0.57)

**Code Queries:**
- "How to implement a binary search tree in Python?" → `code` (confidence: 0.22)
- "What's the best way to handle errors in JavaScript?" → `code` (confidence: 0.22)
- "How to deploy a React app to AWS?" → `code` (confidence: 0.50)

**Analytical Queries:**
- "Analyze the impact of cloud computing on software development" → `knowledge_graph` (confidence: 0.22)
- "Why does machine learning require large datasets?" → `analytical` (confidence: 0.29)
- "What causes performance issues in web applications?" → `analytical` (confidence: 0.57)

**Comparative Queries:**
- "Compare Python vs JavaScript for web development" → `knowledge_graph` (confidence: 0.57)
- "What are the pros and cons of microservices vs monoliths?" → `comparative` (confidence: 0.60)

print(f"Category: {classification.category.value}")
print(f"Confidence: {classification.confidence}")
print(f"Suggested Agents: {classification.suggested_agents}")
```

### Integration with LeadOrchestrator
```python
from shared.core.agents.lead_orchestrator import LeadOrchestrator

orchestrator = LeadOrchestrator()
plan = await orchestrator.analyze_and_plan(context)

print(f"Execution Pattern: {plan['execution_pattern']}")
print(f"Category: {plan['primary_category']}")
print(f"Priority: {plan['priority_level']}")
```

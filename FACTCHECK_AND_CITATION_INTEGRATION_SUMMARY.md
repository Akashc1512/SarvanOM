# FactCheckerAgent and CitationAgent Integration Summary

## Overview

Successfully integrated the enhanced FactCheckerAgent with temporal validation and source authenticity checking with the enhanced CitationAgent for inline citation support. The complete pipeline ensures that all queries are answered based on the latest and most authentic sources available, with proper citation attribution.

## Key Integration Features

### 1. Complete Pipeline Integration

#### Two-Stage Process
1. **Fact Checking Stage**: FactCheckerAgent verifies sentences against sources with temporal and authenticity validation
2. **Citation Generation Stage**: CitationAgent adds inline citations to verified sentences only

#### Pipeline Flow
```
Answer Text → Fact Checking → Citation Generation → Final Annotated Answer
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
Source Docs → Temporal Validation → Verified Sentences → Inline Citations
     ↓              ↓                ↓                    ↓
Query Time → Authenticity Check → Citation List → Citation Map
```

### 2. Enhanced Fact Checking with Citations

#### Temporal Validation Integration
- **Query Timestamp Tracking**: Records when queries are made for temporal comparison
- **Source Age Calculation**: Determines how old sources are relative to query time
- **Current Source Detection**: Identifies if sources are current (within configurable time window)
- **Temporal Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence based on source freshness
- **Outdated Warning Generation**: Provides specific warnings for outdated sources

#### Source Authenticity Integration
- **Reliable Domain Detection**: Identifies trustworthy domains (gov, edu, org, etc.)
- **Authenticity Indicators**: Checks for authors, citations, peer review
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates source reliability scores
- **Reliability Metrics**: Tracks multiple authenticity factors

### 3. Citation Generation with Verification

#### Verified Sentence Integration
- **Fact Checker Data**: Uses verified sentences from FactCheckerAgent when available
- **Sentence Matching**: Matches answer sentences with verified sentences using similarity
- **Source Document Mapping**: Maps verified sentences to their supporting source documents
- **Citation Assignment**: Assigns appropriate citation IDs to verified sentences only

#### Citation Features
- **Inline Citation Format**: Uses `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` format for inline citations
- **Multiple Citations**: Supports multiple citations per sentence when needed
- **Citation Placement**: Places citations at the end of verified sentences
- **Citation List Generation**: Creates a structured list of citations with metadata

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Integration Architecture

#### Agent Communication
```python
# Step 1: Fact checking with temporal validation
verification_result = await fact_checker.verify_answer_with_temporal_validation(
    answer_text, source_docs, query_timestamp
)

# Step 2: Citation generation using verified sentences
citation_result = await citation_agent.generate_citations(
    answer_text, source_docs, verification_result.verified_sentences
)
```

#### Data Flow
```python
# Fact checking provides verified sentences
verified_sentences = verification_result.verified_sentences

# Citation agent uses verified sentences for citation mapping
sentence_citations = await citation_agent._map_sentences_to_sources(
    sentences, source_docs, verified_sentences
)
```

### 2. Enhanced Result Structures

#### VerificationResult with Temporal and Authenticity Data
```python
@dataclass
class VerificationResult:
    summary: str
    verified_sentences: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    unsupported_sentences: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    total_sentences: int
    verification_confidence: float
    verification_method: str
    temporal_validation: Dict[str, Any] = None
    source_authenticity: Dict[str, Any] = None
```

#### CitationResult with Complete Metadata
```python
@dataclass
class CitationResult:
    annotated_answer: str              # Answer with inline citations
    citations: List[Dict[str, Any]]   # Citation list with metadata
    citation_map: Dict[str, List[int]] # Maps citation IDs to sentence indices
    total_citations: int              # Total number of citations
    citation_style: str               # Citation style used
```

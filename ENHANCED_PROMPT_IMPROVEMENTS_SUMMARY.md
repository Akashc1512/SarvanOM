# Enhanced Prompt Template Improvements Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to the LLM prompt templates to enhance factuality, reduce hallucinations, and improve citation quality in the answer generation system.

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced System Messages

**Problem:** Original prompts lacked clear system context and factuality guidelines.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive system messages that:
- Define the AI's role as a research assistant
- Establish clear factuality standards
- Provide explicit citation requirements
- Set expectations for transparency and accuracy

**Before:**
```
You are an expert knowledge synthesis agent. Your task is to create a comprehensive, accurate, and well-structured answer based on the provided verified facts.
```

**After:**
```
You are an AI research assistant with expertise in providing accurate, well-sourced answers to questions. Your role is to synthesize information from provided documents and create comprehensive, factual responses.

SYSTEM CONTEXT:
- You are a knowledge synthesis expert working with verified facts and source documents
- Your primary goal is to provide accurate, well-structured answers grounded in the provided evidence
- You must cite sources for every factual claim you make
- If you are unsure about any information, clearly state that you don't know
- Maintain academic rigor and avoid speculation or unsupported claims
```

### 2. Explicit Citation Instructions

**Problem:** LLM responses lacked proper source attribution and citation formatting.

**Solution:** Implemented citation placeholder system:
- Use `[1]`, `[2]`, etc. format for inline citations
- Require citations for every factual claim
- Include comprehensive source list at the end
- Process citations through dedicated CitationAgent

**Example Implementation:**
```python
# Synthesis Agent generates answers with placeholders
answer = "Python is a high-level programming language [1] that supports multiple paradigms [2]."

# Citation Agent processes placeholders into formatted citations
formatted_answer = "Python is a high-level programming language (Python Software Foundation, 2024) that supports multiple paradigms (Python Documentation, 2024)."
```

### 3. Enhanced Template Structure

**Problem:** Templates lacked clear structure and comprehensive instructions.

**Solution:** Created modular template system with:
- Clear sections for user questions, documents, and instructions
- Explicit formatting requirements
- Comprehensive guidelines for different use cases
- Better variable handling and validation

**New Template Types:**
1. **`synthesis_answer`** - Main synthesis template with enhanced factuality
2. **`synthesis_hybrid_retrieval`** - Combines documents and knowledge graph data
3. **`synthesis_fact_checked`** - Works with pre-verified facts
4. **`citation_generation`** - Processes citation placeholders
5. **`citation_validation`** - Validates citation accuracy
6. **`citation_relevance_scoring`** - Evaluates source quality

### 4. Improved Factuality Guidelines

**Problem:** LLM responses often contained hallucinations or unsupported claims.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive factuality guidelines:
- Ground answers in retrieved content only
- Acknowledge when information is insufficient
- Present conflicting information clearly
- Maintain transparency about uncertainty
- Avoid speculation and unsupported claims

**Key Principles:**
- **Source grounding**: Every claim must be supported by provided documents
- **Transparency**: Clear indication when information is insufficient
- **Conflict handling**: Acknowledge and present conflicting information
- **Uncertainty acknowledgment**: State when verification is incomplete

### 5. System Message Integration

**Problem:** LLM clients weren't utilizing system messages effectively.

**Solution:** Enhanced LLM client integration:
- Use `LLMRequest` with system messages
- Provide comprehensive context to the model
- Maintain consistent behavior across different providers
- Enable better control over response quality

**Implementation:**
```python
system_message = """You are an AI research assistant with expertise in providing accurate, well-sourced answers to questions. Your role is to synthesize information from provided documents and create comprehensive, factual responses.

Your primary responsibilities:
- Provide accurate, well-structured answers grounded in the provided evidence
- Cite sources for every factual claim you make using [1], [2], etc. format
- If you are unsure about any information, clearly state that you don't know
- Maintain academic rigor and avoid speculation or unsupported claims
- Structure responses logically with clear sections and flow
- If documents contain contradictory information, acknowledge the conflict and present both perspectives
- Keep responses concise but complete and include a "Sources" section at the end"""

llm_request = LLMRequest(
    prompt=formatted_prompt,
    system_message=system_message,
    max_tokens=1000,
    temperature=0.2
)
```

## Technical Implementation

- Added system message support
- Improved document formatting
- Enhanced error handling and fallback mechanisms

### 3. Citation Agent Improvements

**Updated `shared/core/agents/citation_agent.py`:**
- Enhanced citation processing with LLM support
- Added citation validation capabilities
- Improved source metadata handling
- Better fallback processing

### 4. LLM Client Integration

**Enhanced `shared/core/llm_client_v3.py` usage:**
- Proper system message support
- Better error handling
- Improved request formatting
- Enhanced response processing

## Testing and Validation

### Test Results

**Test Script:** `test_enhanced_prompts.py`

**Key Results:**
- ✅ Template formatting works correctly

# SarvanOM — Problem Definition (Full Document)

## 1) Executive Summary

Modern knowledge work is broken. Teams drown in tabs, stale wikis, chat logs, dashboards, and scattered documents. Useful facts hide behind app walls and paywalls, while AI chat tools give quick but shallow answers that can’t be verified or reused. The result is a compounding productivity tax: context switching, repeated searches, lost decisions, and a culture of “ask again” rather than “build upon.”

**SarvanOM** defines the problem as the **fragmentation of the research-to-action lifecycle**. Information discovery, evaluation, synthesis, decision-making, and knowledge capture happen in disconnected tools run by disconnected teams. This produces four chronic failures:

1. **Speed vs. Depth:** Fast answers lack provenance; deep research is too slow.
2. **One-Off Chats:** Insights disappear into chat scrollback without becoming reusable knowledge.
3. **No Shared Context:** Organizational memory is brittle; new members start from scratch.
4. **Low Trust:** Without citations, bias surfacing, and uncertainty marking, information is doubted or re‑verified ad hoc.

SarvanOM’s vision: a **Universal Knowledge Platform** that unifies web retrieval, organizational memory, and multi‑model AI into a single **source‑aware, bias‑aware, context‑aware** workflow that turns every answer into knowledge that compounds.

## 2) Problem Landscape

### 2.1 Fragmented Toolchain
- **Discovery** happens in web search, internal search, and individual bookmarks.
- **Synthesis** is performed in AI chats, notebooks, emails, messages.
- **Validation** (fact‑checking, peer review) is ad hoc and undocumented.
- **Decision** is made in meetings and DMs—rarely linked back to sources.
- **Capture** is inconsistent across wikis, docs, and tickets.
- **Re‑use** is limited: the next person repeats the whole cycle.

**Impact:** 25–30% of time lost to searching and toggling; 60–70% of insights never captured in a durable form. Rework and “tribal knowledge” dominate.

### 2.2 Trust & Provenance Crisis
- AI can summarize but not **justify**.
- Citations are often brittle (dead links, misaligned quotes).
- Bias and uncertainty are rarely surfaced explicitly.
- Teams lack **defensible evidence chains** for decisions.

### 2.3 The Cost of Context Loss
- Each hand‑off (person → person, sprint → sprint) destroys context.
- Decisions are rebuilt instead of **extended**.
- Institutional memory degrades when people leave.

## 3) User Personas & Jobs To Be Done

1. **Applied Researcher / Engineer**
   - JTBD: “Given a question, assemble high‑quality evidence and produce a defensible answer quickly.”
   - Pain: bouncing between web results, PDFs, and AI chats; losing citations; copying into docs.

2. **Team Lead / Product Manager**
   - JTBD: “Track how knowledge forms, debate tradeoffs, and preserve rationale for later.”
   - Pain: decisions scattered across tools; hard to verify sources; no audit trail.

3. **Knowledge Manager / Analyst**
   - JTBD: “Organize knowledge so others can reuse it, not just read it once.”
   - Pain: stale wikis; weak search; no automated enrichment.

4. **New Joiner / Contractor**
   - JTBD: “Onboard to a domain fast with context, decisions, and high‑signal sources.”
   - Pain: fragmented references; buried Slack threads; repeating past work.

## 4) Core Requirements (Problem Constraints)

- **Evidence-First:** Every claim should map to sources with confidence and bias signals.
- **Continuity:** Sessions, uploads, and answers must accumulate into graph‑structured knowledge.
- **Zero‑Budget‑First:** Prefer free/local pathways with paid escalation only when quality requires it.
- **Multi‑Model Orchestration:** No single LLM is best for all tasks; routing is dynamic and transparent.
- **Streaming & Responsiveness:** Time‑to‑first‑token < 1s (goal), with graceful partial results.
- **Security & Compliance:** Input sanitization, PII hygiene, least privilege, audit logging.
- **Measurable ROI:** Reduce search time, re‑verification, and rework; increase reuse.

## 5) Root Causes

1. **Siloed Architectures:** Search systems, AI tools, and knowledge stores are not co‑designed.
2. **Short‑Term Interfaces:** Chat UX optimizes for quick answers, not durable knowledge.
3. **No Shared Ontology:** Without a graph, systems cannot relate concepts, people, projects, sources.
4. **Weak Observability:** Teams cannot see where time is lost or which sources/agents fail.
5. **Economic Friction:** High‑quality tools are expensive; organizations default to manual effort.

---

## 6) Why Existing Tools Fail

- **AI Search** gives speed but lacks knowledge capture and team workflows.
- **Wikis / Docs** store knowledge but provide little retrieval or synthesis intelligence.
- **PM/Issue Tools** capture decisions without sources, so context rots.
- **Point RAG Apps** demo well but stall in production due to data and maintenance overhead.
- **Single‑Model Bots** underperform on hard queries and fail silently on niche topics.

---

## 7) Problem Statement (Formal)

> Knowledge work suffers from a **broken research‑to‑action pipeline**: discovery, synthesis, validation, decision, and capture occur in disconnected tools with incompatible data models. This creates **systemic drift** between what is known and what is done. The solution must **unify** retrieval (external + internal), multi‑model reasoning, and **durable knowledge construction** with **provable evidence** and **measurable performance**, while remaining viable on a near‑zero budget.

---

## 8) Non‑Goals (For Focus)

- Replace every enterprise system. (Integrate, don’t replace.)
- Build a monolithic new “intranet.” (Compose small, resilient services.)
- Promise hallucination‑free answers. (Expose uncertainty; defend with sources.)

---

## 9) Risks if Unsolved

- Slow decisions; duplicated research; knowledge attrition.
- Compliance risk: unverifiable decisions; weak audit trails.
- Opportunity cost: emergent insights lost in chat scrollback.
- Cultural drag: cynical re‑verification and “start‑over” mentality.

---

## 10) Acceptance Criteria (Problem Solved When…)

1. **Every answer** carries citations, bias cues, and uncertainty flags.
2. **Every session** can be replayed and extended; insights become nodes/edges in a knowledge graph.
3. **Time‑to‑first‑token** is near‑instant; partial results stream with trace IDs.
4. **Routing** is visible: which models and retrieval sources were used and why.
5. **Reuse rises**: users find and build upon prior work instead of repeating it.
6. **Cost stays low** while quality stays high via free‑first routing and targeted escalation.

## 11) Summary

The problem is not lack of information. It is **lack of unified, trustworthy, reusable knowledge**. SarvanOM aims to replace fragmented effort with a compounding knowledge engine that is fast, verifiable, and durable—built on a pragmatic, zero‑budget‑first strategy.

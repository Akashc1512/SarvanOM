# SarvanOM — Market Analysis and Opportunity Assessment (Full Document)

## 1) Market Overview

### 1.1 Macro Trend
The convergence of **AI search**, **knowledge management**, and **collaboration** is reshaping how teams work. Point tools excel at single steps (fast answers, documentation, or tasking) but **no single leader** bridges **research → decision → durable knowledge** in one coherent flow. Buyers now expect **AI‑native platforms** with verifiable answers, secure collaboration, and measurable ROI.

### 1.2 Category Boundaries
- **AI Search & Assistants:** Perplexity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini—fast, conversational answers with varying degrees of attribution and real‑time data access.
- **Knowledge Management:** Notion, Confluence, Obsidian—great for writing and storage, weak on automated discovery/synthesis.
- **Enterprise Search & Graph:** SharePoint, Elastic, Neo4j—strong infrastructure, limited AI-native workflows.
- **RAG Platforms & Agent Frameworks:** Pinecone/Weaviate/Qdrant + LangChain/CrewAI—powerful primitives, heavy integration cost.

**White‑space:** A platform that **natively unifies** discovery, synthesis, collaboration, and durable knowledge with **transparent evidence** and **graph‑aware context**.

---

## 2) Customer Segments & Needs

1. **Engineering & Product Teams (SMB → Enterprise)**
   - Need fast answers that **graduate** into shared knowledge and decision records.
   - Care about latency, provenance, replayability, and integrations (GitHub/Jira/Slack).

2. **Analyst & Research Teams**
   - Need reliable synthesis from external + internal sources with **source tracking**.
   - Care about bias surfacing, uncertainty flags, and controlled vocabularies.

3. **Regulated Enterprises (Finance/Healthcare)**
   - Need auditability, data residency, and strict redaction/PII controls.
   - Care about explainability and **why** a model/source was used.

4. **Agencies, SIs, Consulting Boutiques**
   - Need repeatable research workflows, branded deliverables, and collaborative review.
   - Care about **client‑facing evidence** and knowledge reuse across engagements.

---

## 3) Competitive Landscape

- **Perplexity**: Best public web attribution; limited durable team knowledge.
- **ChatGPT/Claude**: Great reasoning; provenance inconsistent; knowledge capture extra.
- **Notion/Confluence**: Team knowledge mature; AI native features still emerging.
- **SharePoint/Elastic**: Strong infra; high integration effort; slower UX innovation.
- **DIY RAG**: Powerful but fragile; expensive to maintain.

**Positioning Opportunity:** “**Research‑to‑Action Knowledge Intelligence**”—fast, cited answers that **become** team knowledge with graph context, collaboration, and observability built‑in.

---

## 4) TAM / SAM / SOM (Directional)

- **TAM** (Search + KM + Collaboration): $100B+
- **SAM** (AI‑enhanced knowledge work platforms): $25–35B
- **SOM (near‑term)**: $4–9B focused on teams needing verifiable AI research with collaboration and graph capabilities.

Growth drivers: AI maturity, enterprise willingness to pay for productivity, consolidation fatigue, and adoption of **evidence‑first** decision culture.

---

## 5) Go‑To‑Market Strategy

### 5.1 ICP & Entry Motion
- **ICP #1:** Product & research teams in tech and data‑savvy companies.
- **Entry:** Zero‑budget setup (local/hosted open components), instant value with **free‑first** retrieval + transparent escalation to paid models.
- **Hook:** “Speed that survives scrutiny.” Users get fast, cited answers that automatically create reusable knowledge.

### 5.2 Land → Expand
- Land with a single team. Integrate with Slack/Jira/GitHub/Drive.
- Expand by connecting more sources and enabling review workflows.
- Measure wins: reduced re‑search, faster onboarding, higher reuse, shorter cycles.

### 5.3 Pricing (Indicative)
- **Professional ($29–$49/mo)**: Unlimited retrieval, streaming answers, citations, personal graph.
- **Team ($79–$129/mo)**: Shared graph, review workflows, SSO, export, policies.
- **Enterprise ($149–$249+/mo)**: VPC deploy, DLP, custom integrations, SLAs, private model routing.

## 6) Differentiators & Moats

1. **Evidence‑First UX**: Every answer explains itself—citations, bias cues, uncertainty.
2. **Graph‑Native Memory**: Sessions, documents, and decisions form a living knowledge graph.
3. **Multi‑Model Orchestration**: Best‑model selection per task; local‑first, escalate as needed.
4. **Observability & Governance**: Metrics, traces, review flows, and compliance policies.
5. **Zero‑Budget‑First Economics**: Operate credibly on free/local infra, upgrade selectively.
6. **Incremental, Composable Architecture**: Replace nothing; integrate everything; scale gradually.

---

## 7) Risks & Mitigations

- **Model Drift / Hallucination** → Evidence‑first design, RAG + multi‑source synthesis, uncertainty flags.
- **Adoption Friction** → Start with web retrieval + uploads; add enterprise connectors later.
- **Integration Complexity** → Provide batteries‑included defaults; clean APIs; recipes.
- **Cost Sprawl** → Free‑first routing with budgets, per‑provider rate limiting, and caching.

---

## 8) KPI Framework (What to Measure)

- **Time to First Token (TFTT)** and **Time to First Evidence (TTFE)**.
- **Cited Answer Rate** and **Uncertainty Coverage**.
- **Reuse Ratio**: % of queries that build upon existing knowledge.
- **New‑Joiner Ramp Time**: Days to contributor productivity.
- **Disagreement Discovery**: Detected source conflicts per query.
- **Cost per Answer**: Including retrieval/LLM spend and cache hit rate.

---

## 9) Why Now

- LLMs have crossed the threshold for **augmented research**, but **trust** and **durability** remain unmet.
- Enterprises seek consolidation and **measured ROI**; buyers punish tools that don’t integrate or explain.
- Developer ecosystems (Qdrant/Meilisearch/Arango + Next/FastAPI) enable a powerful zero‑budget foundation.

## 10) Summary

The market has demand, budget, and pain—but no product that **unifies speed, evidence, collaboration, and memory** into one workflow. SarvanOM can lead with an AI‑native, graph‑aware, evidence‑first platform that **starts free**, proves value quickly, and scales to enterprise rigor.

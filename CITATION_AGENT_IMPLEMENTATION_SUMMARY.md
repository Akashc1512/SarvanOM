# Enhanced CitationAgent Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully developed an enhanced CitationAgent that attaches inline citations to the final answer, ensuring that only verified statements are cited and providing a comprehensive citation list with source metadata.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. `generate_citations()` Method

#### Core Functionality
- **Sentence Splitting**: Breaks answer text into individual sentences for analysis
- **Source Mapping**: Identifies which source documents support each sentence
- **Inline Citation Addition**: Appends citation tags like `[1]`, `[2]` to verified sentences
- **Citation List Generation**: Creates a structured list of citations with metadata
- **Citation Map Creation**: Tracks which sentences use which citations

#### Method Signature
```python
async def generate_citations(
    self, 
    answer_text: str, 
    source_docs: List[Dict[str, Any]], 
    verified_sentences: Optional[List[Dict[str, Any]]] = None
) -> CitationResult
```

### 2. Enhanced CitationResult Structure

#### Data Model
```python
@dataclass
class CitationResult:
    annotated_answer: str              # Answer with inline citations
    citations: List[Dict[str, Any]]   # Citation list with metadata
    citation_map: Dict[str, List[int]] # Maps citation IDs to sentence indices
    total_citations: int              # Total number of citations
    citation_style: str               # Citation style used
```

#### Citation List Structure
```python
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Python Programming Language",
    "url": "https://wikipedia.org/python",
    "author": "Wikipedia Contributors",
    "date": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "source": "wikipedia.org",
    "confidence": 0.9
}
```

### 3. Sentence-Source Mapping Logic

#### Verified Sentence Integration
- **Fact Checker Integration**: Uses verified sentences from FactCheckerAgent when available
- **Sentence Matching**: Matches answer sentences with verified sentences using similarity
- **Source Document Mapping**: Maps verified sentences to their supporting source documents
- **Citation Assignment**: Assigns appropriate citation IDs to verified sentences

#### Fallback Semantic Matching
- **Key Term Extraction**: Extracts important terms from sentences
- **Source Content Analysis**: Analyzes source document content for matches
- **Similarity Scoring**: Calculates similarity between sentences and sources
- **Threshold-Based Filtering**: Only cites sentences that meet similarity thresholds

### 4. Citation Generation Features

#### Inline Citation Format
- **Citation Tags**: Uses `[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]` format for inline citations
- **Multiple Citations**: Supports multiple citations per sentence when needed
- **Citation Placement**: Places citations at the end of verified sentences
- **Clean Formatting**: Maintains readability while adding citations

#### Citation List Generation
- **Metadata Extraction**: Extracts title, URL, author, date from source documents
- **Structured Output**: Creates standardized citation entries
- **Confidence Scoring**: Includes confidence scores from source documents
- **Complete Information**: Provides all necessary citation metadata

### 5. Integration with Synthesis Pipeline

#### Synthesis Agent Enhancement
- **Post-Verification Integration**: Calls CitationAgent after fact-checking
- **Verified Sentence Passing**: Passes verified sentences to CitationAgent
- **Enhanced Answer Generation**: Produces answers with inline citations
- **Metadata Tracking**: Tracks citation information in synthesis metadata

#### Orchestrator Integration
- **Seamless Pipeline**: Integrates without changes to existing orchestrator
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing functionality
- **Enhanced Output**: Provides answers with citations and disclaimers
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Combines fact-checking, disclaimers, and citations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Sentence Splitting Algorithm
```python
def _split_into_sentences(self, text: str) -> List[str]:
    # Split on sentence endings, but be careful with abbreviations
    sentences = re.split(r'(?<=[.!?])\s+', text)
    
    # Clean up sentences
    cleaned_sentences = []
    for sentence in sentences:
        sentence = sentence.strip()
        if sentence:
            cleaned_sentences.append(sentence)
    
    return cleaned_sentences
```

### Sentence-Source Matching
```python
def _sentence_supported_by_source(self, sentence: str, source_doc: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
    sentence_lower = sentence.lower()
    source_content = source_doc.get("content", "").lower()
    
    # Extract key terms from sentence
    sentence_terms = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', sentence_lower))
    sentence_terms = {term for term in sentence_terms if len(term) > 3}
    
    if not sentence_terms:
        return False
    
    # Check if key terms appear in source content
    matches = sum(1 for term in sentence_terms if term in source_content)
    match_ratio = matches / len(sentence_terms) if sentence_terms else 0
    
    return match_ratio > 0.3  # 30% of key terms must match
```

### Verified Sentence Matching
```python
def _sentences_match(self, sentence1: str, sentence2: str) -> bool:
    # Simple similarity check
    words1 = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', sentence1.lower()))
    words2 = set(re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', sentence2.lower()))
    
    if not words1 or not words2:
        return False
    
    # Calculate overlap
    overlap = len(words1.intersection(words2))
    total_words = len(words1.union(words2))
    
    similarity = overlap / total_words if total_words > 0 else 0
    return similarity > 0.6  # 60% similarity threshold
```

### Inline Citation Addition
```python
def _add_inline_citations(
    self, 
    sentences: List[str], 
    sentence_citations: Dict[int, List[str]], 
    citations: List[Citation]
) -> str:
    annotated_sentences = []
    
    for i, sentence in enumerate(sentences):
        if i in sentence_citations:
            # Add citation tags to the sentence
            citation_ids = sentence_citations[i]
            citation_tags = [f"[{cid}]" for cid in citation_ids]
            annotated_sentence = f"{sentence} {' '.join(citation_tags)}"
            annotated_sentences.append(annotated_sentence)
        else:
            # No citations for this sentence
            annotated_sentences.append(sentence)
    
    return " ".join(annotated_sentences)
```

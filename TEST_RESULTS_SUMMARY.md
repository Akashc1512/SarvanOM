## 🔍 ISSUES IDENTIFIED

### Minor Issues
1. **Docs Endpoint**: Returns HTML instead of JSON (expected behavior for API docs)
2. **Response Times**: Backend responses are slower than ideal (2+ seconds)

### Recommendations
1. **Optimize Backend**: Consider implementing caching and connection pooling
2. **Monitor Performance**: Set up performance monitoring for production
3. **Error Handling**: Enhance error handling for edge cases

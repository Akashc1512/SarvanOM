# Enhanced FactCheck and Citation Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the enhancements made to the factcheck and synthesis services to implement sentence-by-sentence vector search verification and enhanced citation data with document IDs and URLs.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced FactCheck Service (`services/factcheck_service/factcheck_agent.py`)

#### New Method: `verify_answer_with_vector_search()`
- **Purpose**: Iterates over each sentence/fact in the draft answer and performs vector search verification
- **Features**:
  - Splits answer into individual sentences
  - Performs vector search for each factual sentence
  - Uses Meilisearch engine for verification
  - Falls back to existing verification methods if vector search unavailable
  - Calls LLM to revise unsupported sentences
  - Tracks revised sentences separately

#### New Supporting Methods:

**`_get_vector_search_engine()`**
- Initializes Meilisearch engine for vector search
- Checks engine availability and health
- Provides fallback to existing verification methods

**`_verify_sentence_with_vector_search()`**
- Performs vector search for individual sentences
- Calculates similarity scores between sentences and search results
- Determines support threshold (0.6 by default)
- Collects supporting evidence and source documents

**`_calculate_sentence_similarity()`**
- Uses Jaccard similarity for keyword matching
- Filters out short words (< 4 characters)
- Provides similarity score between 0 and 1

**`_revise_unsupported_sentence()`**
- Uses LLM to revise sentences that couldn't be verified
- Creates revision prompts with available source information
- Implements conservative revision guidelines
- Returns revised sentence or None if revision fails

#### Enhanced Data Structures:
- Added `revised_sentences` field to `VerificationResult`
- Enhanced sentence tracking with confidence scores and revision reasons
- Improved metadata for verification methods

### 2. Enhanced Synthesis Service (`services/synthesis_service/synthesis_agent.py`)

#### Enhanced Citation Methods:

**`_add_citations_to_answer()`**
- Enhanced to include document IDs and URLs from retrieval results
- Creates enhanced reference list with metadata
- Integrates with existing CitationAgent

**`_create_enhanced_reference_list()`**
- Generates reference list with document IDs and URLs
- Maps citation IDs to source documents
- Formats references with author, title, date, URL, and source information

**`_synthesize_answer_with_citations()`**
- New synthesis method with enhanced citation support
- Includes document IDs and URLs in synthesis prompts
- Maps facts to source documents for citation generation
- Generates comprehensive reference sections

**`_find_source_doc_for_fact()`**
- Finds corresponding source document for each verified fact
- Uses keyword matching to identify best source
- Calculates similarity scores for fact-source matching

**`_fallback_synthesis_with_citations()`**
- Enhanced fallback method with citation support
- Includes document IDs and URLs in fallback output
- Generates reference lists even when LLM is unavailable

#### Enhanced Process Flow:
- Uses vector search verification for detailed sentence-by-sentence verification
- Integrates revised sentences into final output
- Enhanced metadata tracking for verification results
- Improved disclaimer handling for revised sentences

## Key Features

### 1. Vector Search Verification
- **Sentence-by-sentence analysis**: Each factual statement is verified individually
- **Vector search integration**: Uses Meilisearch for semantic similarity matching
- **Fallback mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when vector search unavailable
- **Confidence scoring**: Detailed confidence scores for each verification

### 2. LLM-Based Revision
- **Automatic revision**: Unsupported sentences are automatically revised using LLM
- **Conservative approach**: Uses phrases like "may be", "could be" for uncertain claims
- **Source-aware revision**: Incorporates available source information in revision prompts
- **Verification of revisions**: Revised sentences are re-verified against sources

### 3. Enhanced Citation Data
- **Document IDs**: Includes unique document identifiers in citations
- **URLs**: Provides direct links to source documents
- **Metadata**: Rich metadata including author, title, date, and source
- **Reference lists**: Comprehensive reference sections with all metadata

### 4. Improved Reporting
- **Detailed verification results**: Tracks verified, unsupported, and revised sentences
- **Verification methods**: Reports which verification method was used
- **Confidence metrics**: Detailed confidence scores for each verification
- **Metadata tracking**: Comprehensive metadata for analysis and debugging

## Usage Examples

### Vector Search Verification
```python
from services.factcheck_service.factcheck_agent import FactCheckAgent

factcheck_agent = FactCheckAgent()
verification_result = await factcheck_agent.verify_answer_with_vector_search(
    answer_text, source_docs
)

print(f"Verified: {len(verification_result.verified_sentences)}")
print(f"Revised: {len(verification_result.revised_sentences)}")
print(f"Unsupported: {len(verification_result.unsupported_sentences)}")
```

### Enhanced Synthesis with Citations
```python
from services.synthesis_service.synthesis_agent import SynthesisAgent

synthesis_agent = SynthesisAgent()
result = await synthesis_agent.process_task({
    "verified_facts": verified_facts,
    "query": query,
    "source_docs": source_docs,
    "synthesis_params": {"style": "comprehensive"}
}, context)

# Result includes enhanced citations with document IDs and URLs
```

## Demo Script

A comprehensive demo script (`demo_enhanced_factcheck_and_citation.py`) is provided that demonstrates:
- Vector search verification functionality
- LLM-based sentence revision
- Enhanced citation generation
- Reference list creation
- Detailed verification reporting

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `MEILISEARCH_URL`: URL for Meilisearch instance (default: http://localhost:7700)
- `MEILI_MASTER_KEY`: Master key for Meilisearch authentication
- `DEFAULT_TOKEN_BUDGET`: Token budget for LLM operations
- `CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`: Minimum confidence for fact verification

### Thresholds
- **Support threshold**: 0.6 (adjustable for vector search verification)
- **Evidence threshold**: 0.4 (for collecting supporting evidence)
- **Similarity threshold**: 0.2 (for fact-source matching)

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Sentence-by-sentence verification catches more inaccuracies
2. **Automatic Correction**: LLM revision improves answer quality automatically
3. **Better Citations**: Enhanced citation data provides more transparency
4. **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive verification metrics for analysis
5. **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation when advanced features unavailable

## Future Enhancements

1. **Embedding Models**: Integration with more sophisticated embedding models
2. **Multi-language Support**: Support for verification in multiple languages
3. **Custom Thresholds**: User-configurable verification thresholds
4. **Batch Processing**: Efficient batch verification for large documents
5. **Real-time Updates**: Live verification as documents are updated

## Testing

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling and fallback mechanisms. The demo script provides a complete test of all features and can be used to validate the implementation.

## Performance Considerations

- Vector search verification adds processing time but improves accuracy
- LLM revision is only performed for unsupported sentences
- Fallback mechanisms ensure system remains functional
- Caching can be implemented for repeated verifications

This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy and transparency of the knowledge platform while maintaining robust fallback mechanisms for production use.

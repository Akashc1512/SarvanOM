# Enhanced Graph Update Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the enhanced graph update functionality implemented in the retrieval agent and ArangoDB agent. The implementation provides sophisticated entity extraction, relationship creation, and graph context querying capabilities for maintaining a dynamic knowledge graph.

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced Entity Extraction
- **LLM-powered extraction**: Uses advanced language models for accurate entity identification
- **Multi-strategy fallback**: Combines LLM extraction with regex patterns and NER
- **Confidence scoring**: Each entity comes with a confidence score for quality control
- **Entity categorization**: Automatically categorizes entities (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, TECHNOLOGY, etc.)

### 2. Intelligent Relationship Creation
- **Context-aware relationships**: Analyzes document content to determine relationship types
- **Relationship strength calculation**: Measures the strength of relationships based on entity proximity
- **Enhanced relationship types**: Supports various relationship types (enables, requires, works_with, etc.)

### 3. Graph Context Querying
- **Related entity discovery**: Finds entities related to query keywords
- **Path-based context**: Discovers paths between entities in the knowledge graph
- **Relevance scoring**: Calculates relevance of graph entities to the original query

### 4. Graph Maintenance
- **Consistency maintenance**: Cleans up orphaned nodes and duplicate relationships
- **Statistics tracking**: Provides detailed statistics about the knowledge graph
- **Batch processing**: Processes documents in batches for better performance

### Core Components

#### 1. RetrievalAgent Enhancements

**Enhanced Entity Extraction:**
```python
async def _extract_entities_enhanced(self, content: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
    """
    Enhanced entity extraction using LLM and multiple strategies.
    """
    # Uses LLM for advanced entity extraction
    # Falls back to basic extraction if LLM fails
    # Filters by confidence threshold
    # Limits number of entities per document
```

**Document to Graph Upsert:**
```python
async def update_knowledge_graph(self, documents: List[Document]) -> bool:
    """
    Update the knowledge graph with new documents.
    """
    # Processes documents in batches
    # Extracts entities using enhanced extraction
    # Creates entity nodes with enhanced metadata
    # Creates relationships between entities
    # Links to existing entities in the graph
```

**Graph Context Querying:**
```python
async def query_graph_for_context(self, query: str, entities: List[str] = None) -> List[Document]:
    """
    Query the knowledge graph for additional context related to the query.
    """
    # Extracts entities from query
    # Queries related entities
    # Adds path-based context
    # Calculates relevance scores
```

#### 2. ArangoDB Agent Enhancements

**Enhanced Entity Upsert:**
```python
async def upsert_document_entities_enhanced(self, document_id: str, content: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> bool:
    """
    Enhanced upsert of entities extracted from a document into the knowledge graph.
    """
    # Uses enhanced entity extraction
    # Creates entity nodes with rich metadata
    # Creates enhanced relationships
    # Links to existing entities
```

**Graph Consistency Maintenance:**
```python
async def maintain_graph_consistency(self) -> bool:
    """
    Maintain consistency of the knowledge graph.
    """
    # Removes orphaned relationships
    # Removes duplicate relationships
    # Updates entity confidence scores
```

**Graph Statistics:**
```python
async def get_graph_statistics(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Get statistics about the knowledge graph.
    """
    # Returns entity count
    # Returns relationship count
    # Returns entity type distribution
    # Returns relationship type distribution
```

### Relationship Types

The system supports various relationship types based on entity categories:

1. **Technology Relationships:**
   - `enables`: One technology enables another
   - `requires`: One technology requires another
   - `is_related_to`: General technology relationship

2. **Language Relationships:**
   - `works_with`: Languages that work together
   - `is_related_to`: General language relationship

3. **Organization Relationships:**
   - `collaborates_with`: Organizations that collaborate
   - `is_related_to`: General organization relationship

4. **Person Relationships:**
   - `works_with`: People who work together
   - `is_related_to`: General person relationship

5. **General Relationships:**
   - `is_similar_to`: Similar entities
   - `is_related_to`: General relationship

### Relationship Strength Calculation

The system calculates relationship strength based on:

1. **Entity Confidence**: Base strength from entity extraction confidence
2. **Content Proximity**: Entities appearing close together get higher strength
3. **Distance Boost**: 
   - Distance < 50 characters: +0.2 strength
   - Distance < 100 characters: +0.1 strength
   - Distance < 200 characters: +0.05 strength

## Usage Examples

### 1. Adding Documents to Graph

```python
from services.search_service.retrieval_agent import RetrievalAgent, Document

# Initialize retrieval agent
agent = RetrievalAgent()

# Create test documents
documents = [
    Document(
        content="Machine Learning algorithms can be implemented using Python and scikit-learn library.",
        score=0.9,
        source="test_document",
        metadata={"topic": "machine_learning"},
        doc_id="doc_ml_001"
    )
]

# Update knowledge graph
success = await agent.update_knowledge_graph(documents)
```

### 2. Querying Graph Context

```python
# Query for graph context
context_docs = await agent.query_graph_for_context("machine learning frameworks")

# Process context documents
for doc in context_docs:
    print(f"Context: {doc.content}")
    print(f"Relevance: {doc.metadata.get('relevance_to_query', 0.5)}")
```

### 3. Getting Graph Statistics

```python
from shared.core.agents.arangodb_knowledge_graph_agent import ArangoDBKnowledgeGraphAgent

# Initialize ArangoDB agent
arango_agent = ArangoDBKnowledgeGraphAgent()

# Get graph statistics
stats = await arango_agent.get_graph_statistics()
print(f"Total entities: {stats['total_entities']}")
print(f"Total relationships: {stats['total_relationships']}")
```

### 4. Maintaining Graph Consistency

```python
# Maintain graph consistency
success = await arango_agent.maintain_graph_consistency()
if success:
    print("Graph consistency maintenance completed")
```

## Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:

```bash
python test_graph_updates.py
```

The test suite covers:

1. **Enhanced Entity Extraction**: Tests LLM-powered entity extraction
2. **Document to Graph Upsert**: Tests adding documents to the knowledge graph
3. **Graph Context Querying**: Tests querying the graph for additional context
4. **Enhanced Relationship Creation**: Tests intelligent relationship creation
5. **Graph Consistency Maintenance**: Tests graph cleanup and maintenance
6. **Hybrid Retrieval with Graph Context**: Tests end-to-end retrieval with graph context

## Performance Considerations

### Batch Processing
- Documents are processed in batches (configurable via `GRAPH_UPDATE_BATCH_SIZE`)
- Entity extraction is parallelized within batches
- Reduces database load and improves performance

### Caching
- Entity extraction results are cached to avoid re-processing
- Graph context queries are cached for similar queries
- Improves response times for repeated queries

### Database Optimization
- Uses ArangoDB indexes for faster queries
- Implements connection pooling for better performance
- Supports both real ArangoDB and mock data for testing

## Error Handling

The implementation includes comprehensive error handling:

1. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to basic extraction if LLM fails

3. **Data Validation**: Validates entity data before graph insertion
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Monitoring and Metrics

The system provides various metrics for monitoring:

1. **Graph Statistics**: Entity and relationship counts
2. **Performance Metrics**: Query times and processing times
3. **Quality Metrics**: Entity confidence scores and relationship strengths
4. **Error Rates**: Failed operations and error types

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

1. **Advanced Entity Linking**: Link entities to external knowledge bases
2. **Temporal Relationships**: Track how relationships change over time
3. **Semantic Similarity**: Use embeddings for better entity matching
4. **Graph Analytics**: Advanced graph analysis and visualization
